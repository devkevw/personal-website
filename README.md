# personal-website
It seems like nowadays everyone has their own website. Here's mine ... sike IN PROGRESS.

### Some notes for things I could add
- when you first load the page, the page, only load big 'Hi' text part first
- some hover effects
  - when hover over 'Hi, I'm Kevin.', the letter jumps.
  - Hobbies blurs ... maybe, maybe not
